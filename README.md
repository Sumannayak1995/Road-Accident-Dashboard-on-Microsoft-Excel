 Road-Accident-Dashboard-on-Microsoft-Excel
 
This project is aimed at analyzing traffic accident data and identifying trends and insights related to casualties. The project will leverage several key performance indicators (KPIs) to measure the severity and impact of traffic accidents, including the total number of casualties by accident severity, vehicle type, road type, and other factors. 
 
Data Cleaning

We've ensured data accuracy by removing duplicate entries from the dataset. To enhance data analysis, we've also created a "Month" and "Year" column from the "Accident Date" data, allowing for easy filtering and visualization based on these temporal dimensions. This data transformation ensures that the dashboard provides more meaningful insights and simplifies data exploration for users.

Pivot Tables and Visualizations

We've leveraged pivot tables for data analysis and as a foundation for building the dashboard. We've also designed a range of visualizations, including Key Performance Indicators (KPIs), charts, and graphs to effectively convey critical insights derived from the dataset. These visual elements make the dashboard informative and user-friendly, providing a clear and actionable overview of the data.

Building the Dashboard

We've constructed an interactive dashboard by integrating pivot tables and visualizations. We've taken care to customize the layout, appearance, and formatting of the dashboard to create an engaging and user-friendly experience. This ensures that users can efficiently explore and understand the data, making the dashboard a valuable tool for data-driven decision-making.

Buttons, Filters and Slicers

In this Excel dashboard project, we've incorporated Buttons, Filters, and Slicers to enhance user interaction. Users can now explore specific data subsets with ease. Filters based on Accident Date, Urban, and Rural areas have been added, enabling users to refine their data views. Additionally, interactive buttons have been included to provide users with dynamic features, making the dashboard more engaging and user-friendly.
